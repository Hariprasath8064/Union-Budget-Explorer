This case study presents the development of a comprehensive database management system for working on the non-tax revenue on central government from the financial year
2021-2023 (as provided in the Union Budget). Non-tax revenue refers to the income that the government generates from sources other than taxation. These revenues are a
significant part of the government's overall revenue collection and are used to finance various government expenditures and initiatives. Non-tax revenue sources can
vary and include a wide range of receipts. Therefore, there is a necessity for a robust data management solution to facilitate the storage, retrieval and analysis of
the scheme-wise distributed data of non-tax revenue.

The context of this case study is the creation of a specialized DBMS  to handle diverse non-tax revenue sources. The DBMS structure accommodates interest income,
dividends, fees, penalties, grants, and more. It empowers officials to retrieve specific revenue data, generate insightful reports, ensure data accuracy, and control
access. This streamlined approach enhances financial management and transparency.

Methodologically, the study involves the design of relational schema optimized for the network model of scheme-wise analysis of non-tax income. The DBMS architecture
encompasses a relational model designed to effectively manage the scheme-wise, sector-wise and different type of non-tax income. Furthermore, the system incorporates
a user-friendly interface for data entry, retrieval and visualization.

The key outcome of the case study is a fully functional Scheme-wise non-tax revenue of union government that facilitates efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of
income details. By integrating the different schemes, pipelines and categories of non-tax income, the system provides researches, economists, and analysts with a
powerful tool to explore and understand the patterns and trends of union budget allocation through non-tax revenue. We also get to know how the budget is allocated to
different schemes and the expenses incurred in different sectors.

The implication of this case study can extend beyond academics and research. This DBMS serves as a valuable resource for predictions and analysis of scheme wise
non-tax revenue thereby acts as a tool to improve the allocation of non-tax revenue in union budget. As future enhancements, the system can be extended to the other
revenue types and can also include the expense aspects to make this system a full-fledged database for the analysis of the whole Union Budget.

In conclusion, the Non-Tax Revenue Database Management System exemplifies the successful application of DBMS principles to address the complexities of managing revenue
data across government schemes and categories. This case study underscores the pivotal role of database technology in advancing our understanding and analysis of tax
allocation, revenue and expense of union government.
